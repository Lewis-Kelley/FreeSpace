A space-themed SRPG in the vein of games like Shining Force and Fire Emblem. As
a general concept, this means a turn-based strategy game where the player
controls a group of characters that can move about a board with the usual
goal of eliminating all of the opposing force, which may either be controlled
by another player or an AI.

This is going to just be a hobby project that I'll be working on in the free
time I don't have. The hope is to learn more about C as well as to gain some
experience in handling a large project.

* Development Status
Right now I'm currently working on the main engine, and as of right now one is able
to start a "battle" and move two units around, toggling between the two with the
space bar. Collision is working, but the images are drifting for some reason.

My next goal will be to get the camera control to work, since it's currently causing
segfaults.
